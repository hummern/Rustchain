"""RIP-302: a disputed job must remain workable by the assigned worker.

`POST /agent/jobs/<id>/dispute` answers the client with "the assigned worker can
re-deliver", but `/deliver` used to accept only `claimed` jobs and no route ever
moved a job back out of `disputed`. That left the worker unable to act on the
rejection reason while the escrow stayed locked (a disputed job is also outside
the TTL expiry sweep), so the only reachable exit was the poster cancelling and
taking the full escrow back — after the deliverable was already readable on the
public job endpoint.
